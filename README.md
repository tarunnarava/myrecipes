this recipes is my favourite fantastic pizza.

i like it too much.

a dish of Italian origin, consisting of a flat round base of dough baked with a topping of tomatoes and cheese, typically with added meat, fish, or vegetables.

 a dish made typically of flattened bread dough spread with a savory mixture usually including tomatoes and cheese and often other toppings and baked.


 It tastes like bread tomato and cheese, chewy, moist, slightly acidic, and sharp.

Then once you apply toppings, that changes it. Ham and pineapple, adds salty, sweet and juicy.

Pepperoni adds a meatiness and spice.

Tuna and sweet corn, an amazing combo, crunch, sweetness and meaty fish.

But then you can go all out, I like bbq sauce instead of tomato on cheese pizza’s.
